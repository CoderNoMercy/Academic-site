title: Video prediction from single starting image
summary: Extract language features  from  VisualCOMET to predict the context information given single image. Combined with the video generation backbone (Ordinary DifferentialEquation and 3D convolutional VAE) and Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) contrastive loss, we generate sharper and temporally coherent videos. **[Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BSQZh9C4Uc3FG6vY-GBdcuNE1s2ED-Pe?usp=sharing)**
