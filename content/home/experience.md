  description = """I did two project this summer including: 1. Used Variational Autoencoder algorithm to get disentangled latent code from pre-processed resting state fMRI data. Extracted code was used to do individual identification (as brain ID). K-means clustering is performed to analyze brain patterns reflected by latent space. I also extend the data from 2D fMRI data to 3D fMRI data. 3D data contains white matters. I analyzed latent code considering 'channel bandwidth' to see the non-informative latent variable and informative variable in VAE model.
2. Took advantage of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation method to establish temporal dynamic model for resting state fMRI data. I analyze the saddle point for latent of latent code. This method brings a new view for spatial temporal modeling compared to existing method like AR model and HMM.
